# Novel Corona Virus 2019

# Python-week-8 Final Project

For this assignment I downloaded owid-covid-data.csv data from the Our World  dataset to complete the assignment.

# Tools Imported
pandas           
matplotlib.pyplot 
seaborn   
plotly.express
geopandas 

# COVID-19 Data Analysis 
This project loads a dataset of COVID-19 statistics using Pandas, a popular Python library for data analysis. It cleans the data by checking for and handling missing values, converts date columns to the correct format, and filters the dataset to include only a few countries of interest (like South Africa, Chile, and China).

Once the data is cleaned and filtered, the project visualizes the trend of total COVID-19 deaths over time using Matplotlib, allowing us to compare how the pandemic progressed in different countries through a line graph.

# What It Does
Loads the COVID-19 dataset using Pandas.

Inspects and cleans the data (handles missing values, converts date formats).

Filters the dataset to focus on selected countries:

South Africa

Chile

Botswana

China

Eswatini

France

Guam

Canada

Visualizes the total number of COVID-19 deaths over time using Matplotlib.

# Output
For the out, there are 4  different graphs to show the trend of total COVID-19 deaths across the selected countries, helping visualize the impact of the pandemic over time.

# How to Run in Jupyter Notebook
1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Then open a terminal or command prompt and run:


pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly geopandas notebook
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook

In the terminal, navigate to the folder where your .ipynb file and owid-covid-data.csv are located, then run:


jupyter notebook
This will open the Jupyter interface in your browser.

3. Run the Notebook

Open the notebook file (Novel Corona Virus 2019.ipynb).

Run each cell step-by-step by pressing Shift + Enter.
